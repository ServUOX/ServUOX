        Haven's resident Healer. A lot of adventurers head out into the wild from here, so I keep rather busy when 
        they come back bruised, bleeding, or worse.<br><br>I can teach you how to bandage a wound, sure, but it's 
        not a job for the queasy! For some folks, the mere sight of blood is too much for them, but it's something 
        you'll get used to over time. It is one thing to cut open a living thing, but it's quite another to sew it 
        back up and save it from sure death. 'Tis noble work, healing.<br><br>Best way for you to practice fixing 
        up wounds is to head east out to Old Haven and either practice binding up your own wounds, or practice on 
        someone else. Surely they'll be grateful for the assistance.<br><br>Make sure to take enough bandages with
